# HousingPrices

My first attempt at doing the Housing Prices Challenge in Kaggle. I used 4 methods: Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. My method was simply getting all the data, convert categorical values into binary dummies, imputing missing data, then regress. Among the 4 algorithms I tried, Gradient Boosting was the method that gave me the best score of 0.13427.
